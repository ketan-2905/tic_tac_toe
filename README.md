# Tic Tac Toe

Welcome to the **Tic Tac Toe** game, a web-based implementation of the classic game where two players, X and O, compete on a 3x3 grid. This project was built using **JavaScript** with an object-oriented design approach, and it features a clean and responsive interface.

## Features

- **Two-player mode**: Take turns between X and O.
- **Real-time result display**: Displays winner or tie after each round.
- **Responsive design**: Suitable for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Simple, intuitive UI**: Easy to use and understand for all age groups.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the game interface.
- **CSS**: Styling for a clean, responsive layout.
- **JavaScript (OOP)**: Handles the game logic and interactions.
- **Font Awesome**: Used for X and O icons to enhance visual appeal.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ketan-2905/tic_tac_toe.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd tic_tac_toe
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## How to Play

- **Goal:** Form a straight line of three of your marks—either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—to win the game.
- **Taking Turns:** Players alternate turns, placing their mark (X or O) in an empty box on the 3x3 grid.
- **Three-Mark Rule:** Each player can only have three marks on the board. When placing a fourth mark, the oldest one disappears, maintaining three marks on the grid. This introduces new strategic opportunities as the game progresses.
- **Victory:** Manage your disappearing marks while continuing to align three in a row. The first player to form a straight line of three wins the game!

## Future Enhancements

- **Single-player mode**: Play against a computer opponent.
- **Score tracking**: Keep a record of player scores across multiple rounds.
